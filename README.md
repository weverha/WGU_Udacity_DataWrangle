# WGU_Udacity_DataWrangle

<h1>Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data Project</h1>

I chose the harbor area of Westport Massechussetts because it is one of my favorite vacations spots to go bay fishing and sailing at. From my experience the area is predominantly wealthy people, vacationers, and sailors. 

Data wrangling techniques were used to transform and map the raw data into a database for further exploration. Checks for validity, accuracy, completeness of data, consistancy, and uniformity were made. Documentation of the procedure was done followed by an assessment of how to improve future data. Python and SQL were used in this process.

The OSM documentation shows that there are three main elements in the OpenStreetMap data: nodes, ways, and relations. Each element has tags that describe what each point is on the map.
<ul>
  <li>Nodes define points in space with an ID, latitude, and longitude.</li>
  <li>Ways define linear features and boundary areas using nodes. Linear examples are roads, rivers, trails, etc. Boundary area examples are national parks, theme parks, camp grounds, etc.</li>
  <li>Relations are ordered lists of data elements that describe the relationship between each other.</li>
</ul>
